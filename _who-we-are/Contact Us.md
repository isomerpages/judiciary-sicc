### **Authorisation for collection of mail and court documents**

_Where a party has appointed representation_

All law firms and a foreign lawyer who is granted full registration (“Full Registration Foreign Lawyers”) are required to notify the SICC Registry of the particulars of person(s) authorised to collect Court documents or mail from the Court on their behalf by submitting a request to authorise user.

Where such authorised persons are no longer authorised, law firms and Full Registration Foreign Lawyers are required to revoke or delete the authorisation immediately by submitting a request in accordance with one of the methods set out above. Until receipt of such notification of revocation or deletion, Court documents and mail will continue to be released to such authorised persons upon production of evidence of identification.

Any counsel on record may collect documents and mail on behalf of his firm and on behalf of the party or parties whom he is representing. Any litigant in person may collect documents and mail intended for him in any matter in which he is a party.

A law firm or a Full Registration Foreign Lawyer may authorise a courier service-provider to collect Court documents or mail from the Court on his behalf. At the time of collection, the authorised courier service provider should produce a letter of authorisation which is printed on the law firm’s or Full Registration Foreign Lawyer’s letterhead and addressed to the authorised courier service-provider. The said letter of authorisation should clearly state the case number, the name of the authorised courier service-provider and the Court documents or mail to be collected. An employee or representative of the authorised courier service-provider collecting the Court documents or mail may be requested to provide evidence that will allow the SICC Registry to verify that he is an employee or representative of the authorised courier service-provider and will have to acknowledge receipt of the Court documents or mail collected.

_Where a party is a litigant in person, or who has yet to appoint representation_

Parties to a pending cause or matter in the Court who are acting in person, or who have yet to appoint legal representation, may authorise any particular person to collect Court documents or mail from the Court on their behalf by providing such person with an authorisation letter.

A litigant in person may authorise a courier service provider to collect Court documents or mail from the Court on his behalf. At the time of collection, the authorised courier service provider should produce a letter of authorisation from the litigant in person addressed to the authorised courier service provider. The said letter of authorisation should clearly state the case number, the name of the authorised courier service provider and the Court documents or mail to be collected. An employee or representative of the authorised courier service provider, who is collecting the Court documents or mail, may be requested to provide evidence that will allow the SICC Registry to verify that he is an employee or representative of the authorised courier service provider and will have to acknowledge receipt of the Court documents or mail collected.

The party is responsible to recall or destroy any authorisation letter issued to persons whose authority to collect documents has been revoked.

Court documents and mail will only be released to persons bearing the aforesaid authorisation letter.
