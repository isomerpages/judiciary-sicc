### The Court

The SICC is a division of the General Division of the Singapore High Court and part of the [Supreme Court of Singapore](https://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/) designed to deal with transnational commercial disputes. It is a superior court of law built on the foundations of a legal and judicial system that has been highly regarded and favourably ranked in international surveys conducted by, among others, the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development and the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy. [Click here](https://www.sicc.gov.sg/docs/default-source/about-sicc/sicc-brochure.pdf?sfvrsn=2) to download the SICC brochure for more information.

### Jurisdiction

Generally, the SICC has the jurisdiction to hear and try an action if:

*   the claim in the action is of an international and commercial nature;
*   the parties to the action have submitted to the SICC’s jurisdiction under a written jurisdiction agreement; and
*   the parties to the action do not seek any relief in the form of, or connected with, a prerogative order (including a mandatory order, a prohibiting order, a quashing order or an order for review of detention).

For more information regarding the SICC’s jurisdiction, please refer to Order 2 rule 1 of the Singapore International Commercial Court Rules 2021.

The SICC may also hear cases which are transferred from the Singapore High Court. Third or subsequent parties may be joined to an action where the SICC has or assumes jurisdiction or in a case transferred to the SICC from the General Division of the High Court.

The SICC will not decline to assume jurisdiction in an action solely on the ground that the dispute between the parties is connected to a jurisdiction other than Singapore, if there is a written jurisdiction agreement between the parties to submit the claim for resolution by the SICC.
