### Work Pass Exemptions

From 1 November 2017, a foreign lawyer on the SICC Register of Foreign Lawyers who is registered under section 36P of the Legal Profession Act 1966 is exempted from the requirement of having a valid work pass, subject to the fulfilment of several conditions. Before entering Singapore, the RFL should either be engaged as an employee to perform any specified activity in Singapore for an employer or engaged as a self-employed foreigner by a person to perform any specified activity in Singapore for the purpose of gain, such specified activity as defined in section 36P of the Legal Profession Act 1966. After arriving in Singapore and before starting to perform the specified activity, the RFL is required to notify the Controller of Work Passes in the Ministry of Manpower, in such form and manner as the Controller may require, of the nature and duration of the specified activity. He/She can submit the e-Notification to Perform Work Pass Exempt Activities [here](http://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/e-notification-to-perform-work-pass-exempt-activities). Thereafter, the exemption shall apply for the first 90 days in a year, or such longer period as the Controller may allow in a particular case.
