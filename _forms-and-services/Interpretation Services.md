All hearings in the SICC are conducted in the English language. The Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section provides interpretation services to witnesses in court proceedings who do not understand or speak English. The languages and dialects covered by the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section are listed [here](https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/services/interpretation-services).

Parties represented by lawyers in civil matters must submit their requests for interpretation services using the Request for Hearing Administrative Support module on eLitigation.

Unrepresented parties may submit their requests using the [Request by Unrepresented Party for Interpretation Services Form.](https://form.gov.sg/#!/60909eac32cd9c00116b719c)

All requests should be submitted not later than 7 working days before the day on which the services of an interpreter are required. Parties will be informed of the outcome of their request within 3 working days upon receipt of the request by the Supreme Court.

A fee of $300 per day or part thereof will be charged for open court hearings. Court interpretation services for hearings in chambers are free of charge. Any interpretation fees must be paid upon approval of the request.

Parties intending to engage interpretation services for languages not covered by the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section may source for their own interpreters. Parties who engage private interpreters should note that private interpreters will be required to take the interpreter’s oath before a duty registrar prior to the commencement of the trial or hearing. The form of the interpreter’s oath can be found [here](https://www.sicc.gov.sg/docs/default-source/forms/oath-form.doc).
