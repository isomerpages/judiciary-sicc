Court documents are generally required to be filed, served, delivered or otherwise conveyed to the Registrar through the [Electronic Filing Service](https://www.elitigation.sg/_layouts/IELS/HomePage/Pages/Home.aspx).

Where it is impracticable for court documents to be filed, served, delivered or otherwise conveyed to the Registrar through the Electronic Filing Service, the court documents may be filed, served, delivered or otherwise conveyed in the following manner:

*  by way of email forwarded to [Supcourt\_SICCRegistry@supcourt.gov.sg](mailto:Supcourt_SICCRegistry@supcourt.gov.sg);
*    by providing soft copies of the documents in Portable Document Format (PDF) in one or more CD-ROM or other forms of portable storage device to the SICC Registry by way of personal delivery or courier. The storage media or device that is provided will be retained by the SICC Registry as part of the record of the case; or
*   by uploading soft copies of the documents in Portable Document Format (PDF) in online folders designated by the SICC Registry for such purposes. Counsel are required to make prior arrangements with the SICC Registry for access to such online folders before this option may be utilised.**
