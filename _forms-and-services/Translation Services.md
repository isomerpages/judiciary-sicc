The Supreme Court’s Interpretations Section provides translation services from Chinese, Malay and Tamil into English for documents to be filed or used in the Supreme Court, including the SICC. All requests should be made to the Supreme Court's Interpreters Section at least 4 weeks before the date that the translated documents are required.

Parties represented by lawyers in civil matters must submit their requests for translation services using the Request for Hearing Administrative Support module on the [Electronic Filing Service](https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/services/elitigation).

Unrepresented parties may submit their requests using the [Request by Unrepresented Party for Translation Services Form](https://form.gov.sg/#!/6098eccc1916c800111e359c).

The Supreme Court's Interpreters Section may decline any translation request for any reason.

The fee payable for a certified translation by a court interpreter is $45 per translated page. The total translation fee will only be advised upon completion of the translation.
