Supreme Court Transcription Services
The Supreme Court Digital Transcription System (DTS) is the system used to facilitate the digital audio recording of court proceedings and the preparation of transcripts in the Supreme Court.

DTS is available for use in SICC open Court and Chamber proceedings. For hearings where DTS is used, the audio recording is, pursuant to Order 20 rule 9(2) of the Singapore International Commercial Court Rules 2021, the official record of hearing.

Subject to the Court’s approval and upon payment of the requisite fee, parties may obtain a copy of the audio recording or transcript of court proceedings.

Epiq Singapore Pte Ltd is the service provider for the DTS audio recording and transcription services in the Supreme Court. The applicable fees for audio recordings and certified transcripts may be viewed in the schedule here.

Please note that all transcripts and audio recordings are not to be reproduced, copied or transmitted in any form by any means whatsoever, without prior approval of the court.

(b)  I will only use the audio recording for the preparation for hearings or appeals in the Singapore courts;

(c)  I will not upload, distribute or cause to be uploaded or distributed, whether on the Internet, on any social media, on any messaging service, or otherwise, the audio recordings without prior written permission from the Judge, nor will I make the audio recordings available to any other individual or entity (other than in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) below);

(d)  I understand that I may make the audio recording available to a member of staff whose actions I am responsible for, or a service provider that is in the business of making transcripts from audio recordings, for the sole purpose of generating transcripts of the audio recording for the preparation for hearings or appeals in the Singapore courts;

(e)  I will ensure that any person that obtains the audio recording from me will be made aware of the approved uses of the audio recordings, and I remain liable for unapproved distribution or use of the audio recordings by any such person;

(f)  I understand that if a certified transcript of the official record of hearing is required for any legal proceedings (including appeals), such a certified transcript must be obtained from the Court. Normal fees/charges would apply in respect of such a certified transcript;

(g)  I understand that the Court will not entertain any request to decide on (i) the accuracy of an unofficial transcript, or (ii) if more than one unofficial transcript is produced or obtained, which unofficial transcript to adopt. If there are issues or disputes relating to unofficial transcripts, the parties are to obtain a certified transcript of the official record of hearing from the Court. Normal fees/charges would apply in respect of such a certified transcript;

(h)  my attention has been drawn to s.4 of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016. I will ensure that every other individual or entity that obtains the audio recording from me is also made aware of this provision.”

For the avoidance of doubt, the Court will not certify any unofficial transcript as a certified transcript of the official record of hearing. If a certified transcript of the official record of hearing is required for legal proceedings (including appeals), such a transcript must be obtained from the Court.  Normal fees/charges would apply in respect of such a certified transcript.

The Court will not entertain any request to decide on (i) the accuracy of an unofficial transcript, or (ii) if more than one unofficial transcript is produced or obtained, which unofficial transcript to adopt.

Normal fees/charges would apply in respect of such a certified transcript.

For trials that are conducted in camera, special reasons and permission of the Judge is required, before audio recordings are released.

For the avoidance of doubt, audio recordings are only available for trial proceedings and not for appeals or any other non-trial proceedings.
