Case file inspection by parties to a case
-----------------------------------------

All parties to a case may, subject any directions of the SICC, access the online case file.

Where a party to a case is a registered user of the [Electronic Filing Service](http://www.judiciary.gov.sg/services/elitigation), that party may access the online case file through the Electronic Filing Service directly and may inspect, download soft copies or print hard copies of documents accessible to the parties in the online case file.

Where a party to a case is not a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service, or is unable to access the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service, he may either: (a) submit a request to the SICC Registry; or (b) attend at the Lawnet & CrimsonLogic Service Bureau (“Service Bureau”), whose addresses and contact details may be found on the eLitigation website at https://www.elitigation.sg, to inspect or download copies of documents accessible to the parties in the online case file, or for hard copies of such documents to be provided. Printing charges may be chargeable for reproducing documents in paper form.

All parties to a case shall have the liberty to make amendments to administrative details contained in the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service. Administrative details include the contact details of counsel, the identities of counsel, and the nature of the claim. Where a party to a case is not a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service or is unable to access the case file through the Electronic Filing Service, he may attend at the Service Bureau to seek assistance to amend the administrative details contained in the electronic case file.

The SICC Registry may require parties to a case to provide supporting documents to substantiate proposed amendments to other details of the electronic case file before the amendment is allowed to be effected. For example, amendments to add or remove a party to the case have to be supported by an order of court; and amendments to change the name, gender, identification number, or marital status of a party to the case have to be substantiated by documentary proof.

### Case file inspection by non-parties

A request must be made to obtain leave to inspect the case file. The request shall be in [this form](https://www.sicc.gov.sg/docs/default-source/forms/case-file-inspection/request-for-inspection-form.docx) and must satisfy the requirements stated in Order 1 rule 15(4) of the [Singapore International Commercial Court Rules 2021 ("SICC Rules 2021")](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/SCJA1969-S924-2021?DocDate=20211202) and must be [submitted in one of the ways set out here](https://www.sicc.gov.sg/guide-to-the-sicc/communications-with-the-sicc-registry).

In processing the request, the Registrar may seek clarification from the applicant before deciding whether the request may be approved.

Unless prior approval is obtained from the SICC, all information obtained in the course of inspection should not be used for purposes other than those stated by the requestor in the request to inspect.

A case file which has been sealed shall not be inspected by a non-party to those proceedings unless permission of Court is obtained pursuant to Order 16 rules 9(6) and (7) of the [SICC Rules 2021](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/SCJA1969-S924-2021?DocDate=20211202).
