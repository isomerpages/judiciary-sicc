The SICC is part of the Supreme Court of Singapore and is a division of the General Division of the High Court. It is a superior court of law. The enforcement of judgments of the SICC is thus no different from the enforcement of judgments of other superior courts that are regularly chosen in dispute resolution clauses in cross-border consensual agreements. As the SICC’s jurisdiction is primarily consensual, parties who have voluntarily chosen to have their disputes adjudicated by the SICC are not expected to need to resort to enforcement measures.  
  
Nonetheless there are means of enforcement that may be utilised.

The Asian Business Law Institute has released its first [publication](https://www.abli.asia/projects/foreign-judgments-project), **Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Asia**. It features 15 country reports (covering each of the ASEAN Member States, Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea) written by legal academics and practitioners in their respective countries on how foreign judgments in civil and commercial matters are recognised in Asia. The objective of this project is to facilitate cross-border transactions by lowering transaction costs and associated legal friction through the greater portability of judgments in this region.
