##### Commencement of proceedings and adjudication tracks
There is a single mode of commencement for SICC proceedings, which is by filing an Originating Application. Unless otherwise provided in the Singapore International Commercial Court Rules 2021, the SICC will order that a contested claim or counterclaim be decided by one of the following adjudication tracks: pleadings, statements, or memorials.

##### Applicability of the Evidence Act 1893 in SICC proceedings

The SICC is not bound to apply any rule of evidence under Singapore law (including rules contained in the Evidence Act 1893 and common law) in such cases and to such extent as the [Singapore International Commercial Court Rules 2021](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/SCJA1969-S924-2021?DocDate=20211202) may provide. The SICC may apply other rules of evidence (whether such rules are found in foreign law or otherwise) if an order is made on an application of party pursuant to Order 13 Rule 15 of the [Singapore International Commercial Court Rules 2021](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/SCJA1969-S924-2021?DocDate=20211202).

##### Proof of foreign law in SICC proceedings
In line with the international character of the SICC, pursuant to Order 16 Rule 8 of the [Singapore International Commercial Court Rules 2021](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/SCJA1969-S924-2021?DocDate=20211202) the SICC may, on the application of a party, order that any question of foreign law be determined on the basis of oral and/or written submissions instead of proof.

##### Making an application or filing an appeal to the Court of Appeal
This section provides guidance as to when a party should make an application to the Court of Appeal as opposed to file an appeal against the decision of the SICC.

Where an application may be made either to the SICC or to the Court of Appeal, and the application is first made to the SICC pursuant to s 57 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969:

(a) If the application is refused by the SICC, and the applicant still wishes to obtain the relief sought in the refused application, the applicant should make an application to the Court of Appeal for the same relief, instead of filing an appeal to the Court of Appeal; and

(b) in any event, any party who wishes to vary or discharge any direction or order made by the SICC on the application should likewise make an application to the Court of Appeal to vary or discharge that direction or order, instead of filing an appeal to the Court of Appeal.

Except as provided above, any party who is dissatisfied with a decision of the SICC may file an appeal to the Court of Appeal against that decision in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 and the applicable rules of civil procedure.

For proceedings governed by the Singapore International Commercial Court Rules 2021, the above information may also be found in Section 15.5 of the applicable [SICC Procedural Guide.](https://www.sicc.gov.sg/legislation-rules-pd/sicc-procedural-guide)
