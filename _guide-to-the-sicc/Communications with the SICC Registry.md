All requests relating to or in connection with any pending cause or matter are to be made using the prescribed forms (if available) under:

the Singapore International Commercial Court Rules 2021 and the corresponding SICC Procedural Guide, for proceedings governed by those Rules; or
Appendix B of the SICC Practice Directions, for proceedings governed by the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5), as modified by Order 110 of those Rules.
Where a prescribed form is available, the SICC Registry has the discretion to decline to process any request that is not made in the appropriate form. Where there are no prescribed forms available for the request, the request may be made by way of correspondence addressed to the Registrar.

Unless otherwise ordered by the SICC, all requests relating to or in connection with any pending cause or matter are to be submitted to the SICC Registry in one of the following ways:

by online submission through the Electronic Filing Service;
by way of email forwarded to Supcourt_SICCRegistry@supcourt.gov.sg;
by post to the attention of the SICC Registry; or
by delivery at the counter of the SICC Registry.
Further, all requests:

should be captioned with the number of the cause or matter to which they relate and the names of the parties. If the request or correspondence relates to an interlocutory application, the number of that interlocutory application should be stated in the caption below the partiesâ€™ names; and
are to be copied to all other parties to the cause or matter or to their counsel unless there are good reasons for not so doing. Counsel are further reminded that the Court should not be copied on correspondence between parties or their counsel. The SICC Registry has the discretion to reject or decline to act on any inappropriate or without notice correspondence.
