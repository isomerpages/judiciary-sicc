The choice of SICC as a dispute resolution forum should ideally be made when contracts are negotiated and entered into. However, parties can enter into an agreement to submit to the jurisdiction of the SICC at any other time, such as after a dispute has arisen. Parties may, after having chosen the SICC as a dispute resolution forum, also agree to limit or exclude their rights of appeal against the SICC judgment.
