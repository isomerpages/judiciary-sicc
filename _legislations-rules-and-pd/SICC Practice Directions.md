The SICC Practice Directions, which set out procedural guidelines for court proceedings, apply only to proceedings that continue to be governed by the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5), as modified by Order 110 of those Rules. The SICC Practice Directions do not apply to proceedings governed by the Singapore International Commercial Court Rules 2021, as the relevant provisions have been incorporated in those Rules.
